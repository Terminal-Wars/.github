![**TerminalWars** is an attempt to create a multiplayer D&D-like experience that can be used for regular D&D, but also more simplified campaigns that are focused more on story and (some-times) jokes, thanks in large part for the plan to have three values that are actually required when creating a character. While the experience of a text adventure will be retained, graphical elements such as profile pictures and visual attacks are also present. Players are also albe to create minigames using TIC-80 (which is a clone of PICO-8) or BASIC, and make opponents play them as part of their attack.  A rewrite of the game was started recently after a long hiatus that will hopefully be less ambitious then before.

### sticky note(s) for anyone interested in helping:

Most programs are done with Golang because there's usually no toolchain or extra libraries that are required unless you specify them (i.e. libpng or gtk), and a version from March 2022 can still compile to the old kernel used. That said, this version is **1.17**, and **1.18 will compile binaries that are incompatible with the TerminalWars kernel. You need Go 1.17 specifically, so please make sure you have a second (or main) Golang install at this version**
