![**TerminalWars** is an attempt to create a multiplayer D&D-like experience that can be used for regular D&D, but also more simplified campaigns that are focused more on story and (some-times) jokes, thanks in large part for the plan to have three values that are actually required when creating a character. While the experience of a text adventure will be retained, graphical elements such as profile pictures and visual attacks are also present. Players are also albe to create minigames using TIC-80 (which is a clone of PICO-8) or BASIC, and make opponents play them as part of their attack.  A rewrite of the game was started recently after a long hiatus that will hopefully be less ambitious then before.
